*Everyone who has given suggestions for the mod

*Open source projects used for code or as a codebase or that were used for code or as a codebase:
The Open Jedi Project (OJP) - OpenRP uses some OJP code plus used to be based off of it,
The Multiplayer Xtra mod by XharocK (Dominic Bodman) author of a lot of the admin system code we use or used and some other code we use or used or base code on,
ClanMod (permission given to use ClanMod code from eqrulez/NeWaGe), 
xMod by =X=Master HeX, 
RealJedi by Acrion Trusen,
JAPP by Raz0r

*JA Coders - tutorials, bug fixes, etc at www.jacoders.org, the modbase which OpenRP used to be based on, OpenJK which OpenRP is based on
*Scooper - Euka Login UI .menu file and associated login/registration code(permission has been given by him to use it)
*Tzu and Flame - cvar fixes for sabering
*Erstok - location based damage cvar suggestion for use
*Nile - Shield mod
*Darth NormaN - Elegance HUD which is used as the OpenRP HUD (permission given by him to use the HUD in the mod and modify it if we wish to)
*eezstreet - Complete console text mod (permission given by him to include it in OpenRP)
*Legacy Mods - The Legacy OJP base that OpenRP was previously based on. Code from was used with characters, accounts, the sqlite database, etc.
NOTE: I have tried to rewrite or remove all LegacyOJP code as best I can. This is because LOJP is licensed under the GPLv3, while OpenJK is licensed under GPLv2 (and thus so is OpenRP since it's an OpenJK fork),
(Cont.) If you spot any remaining LOJP code, or think you can rewrite code like code for accounts, characters, etc. (It's best if someone who has not seen LOJP code does this, 
(Cont.) but I'm doubtful anybody will be rewilling to rewrite code), please remove the remaining code or rewrite the code and submit it with a pull request. Thank you.
